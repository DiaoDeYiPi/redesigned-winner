# X-Team 19 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## 1. Meet on time (text/message if you're going to be late or miss)
## 2. Communicate frequently 
## 3. Use GroupMe to communicate
## 4. Always finish projects or assignments one day before the due.
## 5. Always submit after every member have checked the latest version
## 6. Be relaxed and have fun :)
