# X-Team 19 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## 1. Meet on time (text/message if you're going to be late or miss)
## 2. Communicate frequently 
## 3. Use GroupMe to communicate

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
  


## How we willtrack progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
